# **mark**_craft_
#### Server-side mod that brings markdown to Minecraft chat!


Supports all standard formatting, as well as @mentions and any combination of those. (Mentions are purely visual at the moment and do not alert other players)\
It also has special support for colouring using backticks (\`). \`cThis text would be red\`. The character after the first backtick determines the colour. See [Here](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/minecraft-color-codes/) for all characters.
